### **Web Security**

> “The Web Security Academy is a free online training center for web application security.  
> It includes content from PortSwigger's in-house research team, experienced academics,  
> and our Chief Swig Dafydd Stuttard - author of The Web Application Hacker's Handbook.
>
> Unlike a textbook, the Academy is constantly updated. It also includes interactive labs  
> where you can put what you learn to the test. If you want to improve your knowledge of hacking,  
> or you'd like to become a bug bounty hunter or pentester, you're in the right place.”
